## Replacing the Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant

The NSF DDIG was an essential part of graduate education: so much so that many biology programs structured their graduate programs to include a DDIG-like component. Especially in ecology and evolutionary biology, having a way to fund independent student research is seen as key in the community in fostering a culture of intellectual independence. NSF recently had to cancel this program due to administrative overhead, but the community seeks to find ways to help NSF re-establish a program like this, possibly (but not only) through involvement by scientific societies.

One idea is to have an Independent Graduate Research Consortium. A team led by Maren Friesen is drafting a [white paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Niq3kIhGmhKqNQREpocRTPcHbqPlvG9ABnIeHwqzoPg/edit) on this. There is an open [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/independent-graduate-research-consortium-planning) to discuss progress on this.

Another idea is to have a memorandum of understanding between NSF and various scientific societies, as it does with other granting agencies.

A third idea is for NSF to have a competition for groups to administer grants to targeted areas. This is modeled on synthesis centers, like NCEAS, NIMBioS, and NESCent, where there is an intense competition to create a center, and then the centers allocate funds to postdocs, working groups, and tutorials through a rigorous, scientist-centered, review process. This has been described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2mW0APduOKIr09i68AZbTjadvQd_heJZe8iQsCOERw/edit?usp=sharing).

There's also an R package with info on past NSF grants [here](https://github.com/bomeara/NSFgrantparser), which might be useful for highlighting some past successes of the DDIG program.
